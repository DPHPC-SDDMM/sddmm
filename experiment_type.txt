Experiments
===========
1. optimize each algo => get best version
2. experiments multiple matrix sizes, uniform distribution, all algos compared
3. experiments same matrix size, vary sparsity, uniform distribution, all algos compared
4. experiments with sparse matrix data sets, vary sparsity distribution of dense matrices, all algos compared
   => check if kind of distribution even has an impact on the algo performance
5. ask TA about large sparse matrices relevant to sddmm
